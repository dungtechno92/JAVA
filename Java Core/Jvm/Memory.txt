- Heap: save all object in java app.
- Stack: Each thread running in JVM has its own thread stack. 
The thread stack contains information about what methods the thread has called to reach the current point of execution. It also contains all local variables for each method being executed.

- The Java heap and garbage collection:

	+ all heap memory must be reserved up front.
- Classes and classloaders
	+ Permgen(permanent generation) heap area to stored that define object structure and method logic( Config: -XX: MaxPermSize).Size of permgen is fixed while JVM's running.
	  When GC cant garbage collection class and Classloader is still loading new class, we will encouter " java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space" although Heap is not full.
	+ JNI
	+ NIO
